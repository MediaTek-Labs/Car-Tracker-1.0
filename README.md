# Car-Tracker-1.0
Learn how to make use of the GNSS capabilities of the LinkIt ONE development board to acquire the position and the speed of a car. Tracking functionality is provided by uploading location data to the MediaTek Cloud Sandbox (MCS) using a GPRS connection, where the car’s location can be displayed on a map. A bonus feature is the addition of an accelerometer that collects data on the g-forces generated by the car.
An Arduino sketch is implemented, verified and uploaded to the LinkIt ONE development board. 
For the accelerometer operation download the ADXL-345 driver(https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Accelerometer_ADXL345).
The HTTP communication is supported by an HTTPClient driver(https://github.com/amcewen/HttpClient/releases).
